MS18: Implementation of AAI integration at the level of the Identity providers
This milestone refers to the adaptation of UmbrellaID, the PaN community AAI, to the AARC blueprint architecture that has been selected for the EOSC AAI. By partnering with GÉANT, we were able to integrate the GÉANT eduTEAMS platform as the AAI proxy requested by the architecture model.
This setup was in production by the end of 2020, in March 2021 all the existing services of the community were moved to this new EOSC ready infrastructure. 
The report D6.3 provides detailed information regarding this achievement.
