MS20: Second release of PaNOSC services, data and resources 

In addition to the two services (e-learning platform and community software catalogue) registered in December 2020 in the EOSC Portal, we have recently registered 6 new services (not all of them published in the EOSC Portal yet):
•	The ILL data portal https://data.ill.eu 
•	The ESRF data portal https://data.esrf.fr/
•	The CERIC-ERIC data portal https://vuo.elettra.trieste.it/pls/vuo/open_access_data_portal.show_search 
•	The Human Organ Atlas https://human-organ-atlas.esrf.eu/
•	The ESRF notebook service https://jupyter-slurm.esrf.fr/ 

These services focus mainly on data catalogue from the different partners, the notebook service being the first data analysis service released. More services will be registered in the following weeks.
