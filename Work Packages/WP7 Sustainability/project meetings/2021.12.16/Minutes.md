========================================================

### Participants 
Petra Aulin (ESS), Dariusz Brzosko (CERIC-ERIC), Fabio DallÂ´Antonia (EUXFEL), Ornela De Giacomo (CERIC-ERIC), Giuseppe La Rocca (EGI)

### Minutes
------

#### 1. Task 7.2 D7.2 Update
ODG presented the last changes to the deliverable before submission. Giuseppe will adapt the description of EGI to make it similar to other partners, Ornela will  add a paragraph with the introduction to the costs presented by EGI to explain better why these costs are included in the cost collection.

#### 2. Tasks 7.3 and 7.4 future steps
ODG showed the following steps for tasks 7.3 and 7.4. Interviews with WP leaders of WP 2, 4 and 6 were performed, the others will be finalised between next week and the first working days of 2022. WP7 will explore different business models, even if some may not be immediately applicable to the PaN facilities. For the next meeting we propose to re-open the discussion on Business models.
The stakeholders list prepared in the first year of the project needs to be updated, and we need to define now the stakeholders that need to be consulted, regarding the business model to be adopted. According to this feedback, the most suitable business model/s will be developed in the Sustainability plan.

#### 3.  AOB and next meetings
AOB: in the framework of the TF Financial sustainability of EOSC, ODG volunteered to be involved in the sub TF financial models for EOSC-CORE and the federation of data and data services. She also volunteered to liaise with the TF on long term data preservation, hoping that these contributions to EOSC will also turn useful to define a realistic PaNOSC sustainability plan, taking into account all the information on what services the EOSC will and will not provide to RIs.
Next meeting is cancelled (December 30). The WP meetings will resume in January 13 and remain in the same time slot, bi-weekly on Thursdays, from 15 to 16.
