## 1. D8.1 Done

## 2. Content in pan-learning.org
	
### 2.1 Hercules
		Will use notebooks submitted for MS8.5
		Miguel and Nicoletta will get hold of videos from previous Hercules school
		
### 2.1 Upcoming summer school
		Stella & Thomas will draft outline for summer school and present in the next WP8 meeting.
		Everybody are asked to provide input about what they would like to see in the summer school
    We agreed that we should have aimitation of attendees for the summer school to have it manageable (25-30 people)

## 3. MS8.5
	We have received notebooks for ESRF / CERIC & ILL / ESS
	We will receive notebook for ELI next week
	Issues with getting XFEL notebook running due to simex errors. There is however already one to be used for milestone 8.5. 
  Nicoletta can tick the milestone 8.5

  
## 4. Redesign
	Redesign is available here:  https://github.com/pan-training/training-catalogue/issues/36
	Next step is to get it up running on pan-training.eu and registered as EOSC service. 
  We need to test pan-learning.org + pan-training.hzdr.de -> pan-training.eu/catalogue, etc. Alexandre will initiate this.
	pan-learning courses should automatically inserted be in catalog
	Automatic scraping from PanOSC events and LEAPS - LENS &  ExPaNDS are too complicated
